Writeup for Assignment 1

SSH [0/3]

    [x] ssh connection only with ssh-key (you can practice with hulk.soic.indiana.edu)
    [ ] ssh connection with the bypass of the intermediate server (try to connect to sharks.soic.indiana.edu via hulk.soic.indiana.edu)
      - I have been unable to get this to work. ssh-ing into sharks.soic.indiana.edu per normal works fine, but it just hangs if I try via gateway.
    [x] ssh with X-Forwarding (you can test X-forwarding with a light program like gedit)
      - This worked, but quickly crashed with an error that stated, "attempt to access private resource denied".

Docker [0/3]

    [ ] create a docker image using the iuctf.gitlab.io link below
    [ ] test it to see if you can update your docker image (For example, in the container run the command "touch /root/aaa" and your new image should contain the aaa file)
    [ ] migrate a docker image to somewhere else (like a VM) and see if it works

Emacs [0/3]

    [x] install emacs
    [ ] set up org-bullet and org2jekyll on your emacs
    [ ] [reminder] create a document containing write-ups about what you have learned in this assignment and save as a assignment1.org file
