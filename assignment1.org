Writeup for Assignment 1

SSH [2/3]

    [x] ssh connection only with ssh-key (you can practice with hulk.soic.indiana.edu)
    [ ] ssh connection with the bypass of the intermediate server (try to connect to sharks.soic.indiana.edu via hulk.soic.indiana.edu)
      - I have been unable to get this to work. ssh-ing into sharks.soic.indiana.edu per normal works fine, but it just hangs if I try via gateway. Now my computer has restarted, though, I'm going to try again.
        - Nope. Still hangs.
      - For the record, these are the commands I've been using:
          ssh -L 5555:sharks.soic.indiana.edu:22 htdoughe@hulk.soic.indiana.edu
          ssh -p 5555 htdoughe@sharks.soic.indiana.edu

    [x] ssh with X-Forwarding (you can test X-forwarding with a light program like gedit)
      - This worked, but quickly crashed with an error that stated, "attempt to access private resource denied".

Docker [3/3]

    [x] create a docker image using the iuctf.gitlab.io link below
    [x] test it to see if you can update your docker image (For example, in the container run the command "touch /root/aaa" and your new image should contain the aaa file)
      - I can't get Docker to work, going to try restarting my system.
      - That seems to have worked. Image is building.
    [x] migrate a docker image to somewhere else (like a VM) and see if it works

    I'm not sure why Docker had such issues when I first installed it, but restarting my computer seems to have done the trick. Everything works perfectly now, even if making the Docker image took _forever_.

Emacs [1/3]

    [x] install emacs
    [ ] set up org-bullet and org2jekyll on your emacs
      - org2jekyll is on a package manager for emacs that has some certificate issue. I haven't been able to get emacs to ignore that issue.
        - Update: have gotten it to ignore the issue, but the URL is returning a 404 error. This seems to be a backend issue. I'm not sure how to fix this at the moment.
    [ ] [reminder] create a document containing write-ups about what you have learned in this assignment and save as a assignment1.org file
      - What I have learned thus far:
        - Docker assumes you're not going to have any issues at all while setting it up. This is false. Good luck debugging setup.
          - however, in my case at least, turning it on and off again did work. Fortunately.
