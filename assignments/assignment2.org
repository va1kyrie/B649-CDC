            Network
                [x] Review network config
                [x] Can your VM connect to www.google.com?
            Firewall
                [ ] Review rules list
                [ ] Add/Edit/Delete rules
                [ ] What is your firewall strategy?
            User/permissions
                [ ] Review current users and permissions
                [ ] Add/delete users and modify permissions
                [ ] Are there any suspicious users? What is your strategy for dealing with this?
            Logs
                [ ] Where are logs located?
                    - Linux logs are located in /var/log/.
                [ ] Which logs would you prioritize to notice active attacks/suspicious behavior happening on your system?
                    - I would prioritize auth.log, /var/log/wtmp, and /var/log/btmp to notice active attacks or suspicious behavior on this system.
            Processes
                [x] Review process list
                [x] Find suspicious processes (what criteria do you use? e.g. resource consumption?)
                    - Suspicious processes were identified by a combination of user ID and process name. The process called "spyware". for instance, was killed because anything called "spyware" probably doesn't need to be running.
                [x] Kill suspicious processes
