1. Documents your solutions of the last lab (Rubric) [3/3]
    [x] create a directory "assignments" in your git repo
    [x] move your old assignment file "assignment1.org" to assignments/
    [x] create a new file "assignment2.org" with your solutions in assignments/
        RUBRIC
            Network
                [x] Review network config
                [x] Can your VM connect to www.google.com?
            Firewall
                [x] Review rules list
                [x] Add/Edit/Delete rules
                [x] What is your firewall strategy?
                    - The firewall strategy for this system is fairly basic. Outgoing connections are allowed, of course, and incoming SSH connections are as well (because I'm assuming I'm going to figure out what's up with my SSH connections eventually this semester), but other than SSH connections no other incoming connections are allowed.
            User/permissions
                [x] Review current users and permissions
                [x] Add/delete users and modify permissions
                [x] Are there any suspicious users? What is your strategy for dealing with this?
            Logs
                [x] Where are logs located?
                    - Linux logs are located in /var/log/.
                [x] Which logs would you prioritize to notice active attacks/suspicious behavior happening on your system?
                    - I would prioritize auth.log, /var/log/wtmp, and /var/log/btmp to notice active attacks or suspicious behavior on this system.
            Processes
                [x] Review process list
                [x] Find suspicious processes (what criteria do you use? e.g. resource consumption?)
                    - Suspicious processes were identified by a combination of user ID and process name. The process called "spyware". for instance, was killed because anything called "spyware" probably doesn't need to be running.
                [x] Kill suspicious processes
2. Emacs + org + jekyll [2/4]
    [x] fork the class website
    [x] write a org document about SSH regarding what you have learned so far
    [ ] publish the org document to the Tools > Sysenv menu
    [ ] make a "pull request" only about the SSH tool to the class repository
3. SSH [3/3]
    [x] setup the direct ssh connection from your local machine to your VMs
        - I think I've accomplished this? At least, I can ssh into the VM from the local machine (and from my computer via an ssh connection into the local machine).
    [x] run an apache server on your VM and then make it accessible from your local machine
        - Currently half done - apache is installed, but it is not accessible from the local machine because nothing is accessible from the local machine.
        - Now it is all done. I can see the webpage. It is the default, but it is the webpage.
    [x] reverse ssh tunneling: disable your ssh config and ssh-in to your VMs from your local machine
        - Done by default because that is the only way I can access the VM.
