- I have downloaded the two files and run the first one through binwalk. It tells me it is a PNG image with a MySQL database inside it. I do not have MySQL installed on this system (or mariaDB, in my system's case), so I suppose I need to install it. And figure out how to extract the database from the image, given binwalk doesn't want to.
- I am now installing the stego-toolkit. More accurately, I am _attempting_ to install it. It is not really going well. (I'm not sure what's going on with Docker. At least now it's installing the package. It's just taking forever now.)
